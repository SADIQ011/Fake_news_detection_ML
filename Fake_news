In this project, I utilized a diverse set of machine 
learning algorithms including Random Forests, 
Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, and Decision 
Trees to achieve comprehensive fake news detection.

Leveraged the ensemble learning techniques of 
Random Forests and Gradient Boosting to enhance 
model accuracy and robustness by aggregating 
predictions from multiple base learners.   

Adopted a feature-rich approach, extracting relevant 
features such as linguistic patterns, source credibility, 
and social media engagement metrics to feed into the 
models, enabling them to discern between genuine and 
fake news articles effectively.
